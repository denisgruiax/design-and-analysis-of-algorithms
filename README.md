# design-and-analysis-of-algorithms
Solved exercises of the Design and Analysis of Algorithms class.

## Warning. ⚠️
**I do not guarantee the correctness of the code!** ❌

## About the project. 🪴

- ✅ All the necessary operations have been implemented.
- ✅ They were tested with some unit tests.
- ❌ Test coverage is not 100%.

### How to improve the code:
- 👀 Refactoring for better code readability
- 🪜 Better algorithms (+ recursion)
- 🔁 Better unit tests
### Purpose. 🎯
The purpose of this programs is to test the ability to solve problems that consist in the basics of working with: 📚
```sh
1. Generalized trees
2. Binary Trees
3. AVL trees
4. Huffman codes
5. B trees
6. Finding Trees
7. Graphs
8. Weighted Graphs
9. Directed Graphs
```

### Built With. ⚒️
The programs can be build with C or C++ compilers.

## Getting Started. 🚀
### System requirements ✅
- Operating System: MacOS, Windows, Linux(Ubuntu for example), Windows Subsystem for Linux. (WSL)
- Programming Language: C
- Code Editor: Visual Studio Code 

I used WSL as operating system, VSCode as code editor and to compile the code i made use of gcc compiler.

### Installation. 🪜
1. Install c/c++
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install build-essential
   ```

2. Compile from command line
   ```sh
   gcc -Wall app.c -o app
   ```
   
3. VSCode C/C++ extesion pack
   ```sh
   (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools-extension-pack)
   ```
   
4. Configure VSCode to run and debug C/C++ programs inside VSCode under WSL.
   ```sh
   https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-wsl
   ```

5. Install framework for C unit testing and run programs.
   ```sh
   sudo apt install check
   ```

   ```sh
   gcc -Wall main.c generalized-trees.c -o main
   ```
   
   ```sh
   gcc -Wall generalized-trees-test.c ../source/generalized-trees.c -o test -pthread -lcheck_pic -pthread -lrt -lm -lsubunit
   ```
